        <h3 className={`${styles.storyText}`}>After wanting to, and talking about getting a dog for a very long time, Alayna fell into our laps in February of 2021. A friend had been conspiring to find us a dog for years, regularly sending us photos and links for dogs available in the area. One day she sent us a photo of 3 little pitties, all sisters, who a friend was trying to adopt out. They were 2 years old, and had just come to Brooklyn from the south.</h3>

        <h3 className={`${styles.storyText}`}>On a very cold February morning, we walked over to meet Alana, and her sister Henny. We walked them both, liked both of them, but were both drawn to Alayna more. Her personality was so endeering. Her timidness, and slightly smaller size made her seem like a dog we could  realistically accommodate. After some consideration, we decided to do a trial run with her. Those first few days were pretty stressful. She didnâ€™t know us, and had never been away from her sisters before. That first afternoon we all just sat in the linvingroom, unsure what to do. Despite this, her intelligence, gentle nature, and obedience were very clear from the beginning. </h3>

        <h3 className={`${styles.storyText}`}>She stayed with us for 2 weeks before we finally committed to adopting her. In that time, she became more comfortable with us, and we fell for her hard. Alana, became Alayna, to better reflect how her name was pronounced, and the rest is history.</h3>
