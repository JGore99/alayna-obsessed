# **The Alayna Obsession** 

## Description:

I wanted to build a front-end focused project using React, where the subject matter was dear to my heart. So obviously, I built a fan page for my dog. Like all things involving our dog, I choose to play up the pretty pretty princess vibes. Being that she is a pitbull, a breed that is often misunderstood, and can have a negative reputation, we make a very concerted effort in how we present her to outsiders. Tutus and fairy wings, no spiked colors, or choke chains for our unofficial ambassador.

## Objective:

To build a project focused on design, front-end features, and mobile responsiveness, without the use of any CSS frameworks. I wanted to build the slide show, the modals, and the hamburger menu all from vanilla CSS.

This is a free Heroku site, so it may take a few minutes for the page to load the first time.

## Motivation:

To showcase my skills in React and CSS. I’m very interested in front-end development and figuring out how to build visually compelling projects with those tools. I like working out how to do things “the hard way” before using a CSS framework like Bootstrap. Being able to say this is all vanilla CSS is very important to me.
